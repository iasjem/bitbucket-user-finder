# Bitbucket User Finder (Swift)

* This project is part of my journey in learning how to code in Swift based on the [Bitbucket API](https://api.bitbucket.org/)
* The lesson covers various topics including handling APIs and cocoa libraries like Alamofire (including AlamofireImage) and ObjectMapper
* This app is for the purpose of self-study only so that I can broaden my knowledge more with APIs
